# Contract Interaction

A **Contract** object is an abstraction of a contract (EVM bytecode) deployed on the Hedera network. It allows for a simple way to serialize calls and transactions to an on-chain contract and deserialize their results and emitted logs.

A **ContractFactory** is an abstraction of a contract's _bytecode_ and facilitates deploying a contract.
